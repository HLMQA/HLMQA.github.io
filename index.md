<b>Bio</b>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Houda Lamqaddam is a researcher at the intersection of data, technology, and humanistic inquiry, with a focus on integrating computational methods such as data visualization, computer vision, and machine learning into the study of the humanities. Her work critically examines the aesthetic, ethical, and theoretical dimensions of these technologies, exploring how they can empower humanities scholars through tools and frameworks that prioritize agency, interpretability, and critical reflection. Through projects spanning feminist data science, cultural heritage, and visual analysis, her work explores the interplay between technology and human agency, reflecting on the role of computation in advancing equitable, interdisciplinary, and reflective inquiry in the arts and humanities.
